# Emotion-Based-Music-Recommendation-System

In this project, me and my team developed a song recommendation engine using machine learning algorithms in python. We used million song dataset to treat as a dataset and used numpy pandas and recommenders libraries in python. We also used tkinter and pyautogui for creating gui and adding automation respectively. Once the choice of song is selected by the user, the program finds similar songs to it and automatically plays it by opening spotify.

# Working

- Download the files
- Run the data training file for the model to capture different emotions
- Feed those files to the song recommendation model
